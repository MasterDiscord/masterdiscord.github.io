        <p> I love pushing the limits of Elixir, Erlang and anything functional. Working on Discord, the most advanced all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that's free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.  Currently I'm working at <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>, and here's everything I've made.</p>

                <p>Hack.Chat is a minimal, distraction-free, account-less, log-less, disappearing chat service that is easily deployable as your own service. This is a backwards compatible continuation of the work by Andrew Belt. The server code has been updated to ES6 along with several new features including new commands and hot-reload of the commands/protocol. There is also documentation and a changelog. </p>

               <p>Resize images and animated GIFs in Go, hence the name. Lilliput relies on mature, high-performance C libraries to do most of the work of decompressing, resizing and compressing images. It aims to do as little memory allocation as possible and especially not to create garbage in Go. As a result, it is suitable for very high throughput image resizing services.</p>

               <p>Fast no copy globals for Elixir & Erlang. Erlang has an optimization called constant pools for functions that return static data, you can also compile modules at runtime. This method was originally popularized by mochiglobal. This module is an Elixir version with some optimizations such as generating the atom keys and reusing them.</p>

               <p>Fast batch message passing between nodes for Erlang/Elixir. Erlang and Elixir make it very easy to send messages between processes even across the network, but there are a few pitfalls. Inspired by a blog post about boosting performance of message passing between nodes, Manifold was born. Manifold distributes the work of sending messages to the remote nodes of the PIDs, which guarantees that the sending processes at most only calls send/2 equal to the number of involved remote nodes. Manifold does this by first grouping PIDs by their remote node and then sending to Manifold.Partitioner on each of those nodes.</p>

               <p>Fast semaphore using ETS. Programming in Erlang and Elixir usually allows for no locking since the VM essentially handles it for you when communicating between processes. However, what about the situation when you have thousands of processes attempting to interact with a single resource such as a process? Usually they will overload the process and explode the message queue.</p>

               <div class="subtitle">
               <p>A fast consistent hash ring implementation in Elixir. A pure Elixir consistent hash ring implemention based on the excellent C hash-ring lib by Chris Moos. The hashring provides fast lookup, but ring creation isn't optimized (though it's not slow). It deliberately does not provide encapsulation within a GenServer and leaves that up to the user. At Discord we found using a GenServer for such frequently accessed data proved to be overwhelming so we rewrote the hash ring in pure Elixir and paired it with FastGlobal to allow the calling process to use it's CPU time to interact with the hash ring and therefore avoiding overloading a central GenServer.</p>

		Punt is a lightweight and simple daemon that parses, transforms, mutates, and ships logs into Elasticsearch. Punt was built as a fast and reliable alternative to Logstash, which means it's focus is to fit directly into existing ELK setups. Punt was built at Discord to manage the over 4 billion log lines we process per day.</p>

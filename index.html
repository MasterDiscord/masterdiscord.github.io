              <div class="subtitle">
                <p>Loqui is a transport that implements a very simple framing protocol over a raw socket. The framing protocol is similar to http2, except that we've chosen deliberately to not implement a bunch of stuff, like flow control. RTC Transport Layer - with minimum bullshit.</p>

              <div class="subtitle">
               <p>Resize images and animated GIFs in Go, hence the name. Lilliput relies on mature, high-performance C libraries to do most of the work of decompressing, resizing and compressing images. It aims to do as little memory allocation as possible and especially not to create garbage in Go. As a result, it is suitable for very high throughput image resizing services.</p>

               <div class="subtitle">
               <p>Fast no copy globals for Elixir & Erlang. Erlang has an optimization called constant pools for functions that return static data, you can also compile modules at runtime. This method was originally popularized by mochiglobal. This module is an Elixir version with some optimizations such as generating the atom keys and reusing them.</p>

               <div class="subtitle">
               <p>Fast batch message passing between nodes for Erlang/Elixir. Erlang and Elixir make it very easy to send messages between processes even across the network, but there are a few pitfalls. Inspired by a blog post about boosting performance of message passing between nodes, Manifold was born. Manifold distributes the work of sending messages to the remote nodes of the PIDs, which guarantees that the sending processes at most only calls send/2 equal to the number of involved remote nodes. Manifold does this by first grouping PIDs by their remote node and then sending to Manifold.Partitioner on each of those nodes.</p>

               <p>Simple, powerful and fast metrics for Statsd and DataDog You're blind without metrics. Metrics should also be easy to add to you application and have little performance impact. This module allows you to define metrics with ease and see inside your application.</p>

               <div class="subtitle">
               <p>Fast semaphore using ETS. Programming in Erlang and Elixir usually allows for no locking since the VM essentially handles it for you when communicating between processes. However, what about the situation when you have thousands of processes attempting to interact with a single resource such as a process? Usually they will overload the process and explode the message queue.</p>
